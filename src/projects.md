# Projects 

Here's a peek into some of the work I've done recently:

###  Festo Mobile App
Designed and prototyped a mobile app for discovering and booking local events, handling the full UX/UI process from user research to interactive prototype. This project challenged me to combine user-centered thinking with visual creativity, resulting in a smooth and engaging user experience.

### Cafe Website Redesign
As part of a college team project, I helped redesign a cafe website by leading user research, developing moodboards, and creating wireframes that guided the updated layout and visual style. I also designed a refreshed logo, contributing to a cohesive brand identity. The project emphasized a user-centered approach, resulting in a clean and engaging online presence.

###  Musician Documentary
Collaborated on a short documentary film about a musician. Handled pre-production planning including scriptwriting, storyboarding, and creative treatment. Also contributed to interviewing, filming B-rolls, location scouting, editing, audio mixing, and motion graphics integration.

###  P3 Permaculture
Created motion graphics from scratch for a digital course redesign—handled everything from illustration design to final animation, enhancing the course’s visual engagement and clarity.
