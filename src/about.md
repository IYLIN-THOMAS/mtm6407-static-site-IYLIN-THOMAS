# About Me

I'm Iylin Thomas. I am currently studying Interactive Media Design, a 2-year diploma program in Algonquin College, ottawa, Canada. I am an aspiring UX/UI designer and front-end developer. I enjoy combining visuals and logic to create meaningful digital experiences.

Outside of coding, I love exploring visual art, writing, and learning new tools that make creativity even more fun. I'm currently studying web development and building projects that reflect who I am. I blend empathy, research, and creativity to design impactful digital experiences that solve real problems. With a detail-driven mindset and a warm, collaborative approach, I aim to deliver work that builds trust, elevates user satisfaction, and leaves a lasting impression.

This site is a space where I can experiment, learn, and share.
